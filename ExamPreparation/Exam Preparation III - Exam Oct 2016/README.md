## 01.SoftUni Coffee Orders
#### Problem Description
We are placing **N** orders at a time. You need to calculate the price after the discount based on the following formula:
**((daysInMonth * capsulesCount) * pricePerCapsule)**
*Hint – The **DateTime** class may come in handy to calculate the days in month.

####Input / Constraints

- On the first line you will receive integer **N – the count** of orders the shop will receive.
- For each order you will receive the following information:
Price per capsule - **floating-point number** in range [0…79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,335].
Order **date** - in the following format **{d/M/yyyy}**, e.g. 25/11/2016, 7/03/2016, 1/1/2020.
Capsules **count** - integer in range [0…2,147,483,647].
The input will be in the described format, there is no need to check it explicitly.

####Output

The output should consist of **N + 1** lines. For each order you must print a single line in the following format:
- “The price for the coffee is: **${price}**”
On the last line you need to print the total price in the following format:
- “Total: ${**totalPrice**}”
The **price must be rounded** to 2 decimal places. 

## 02.Command Interpreter
#### Problem Description
Jagged arrays, regular expressions, asynchronous programming… Tough stuff. But simple structures like arrays are piece of cake, right? Let’s see how well you can manipulate data in a collection.
You will be given a series of strings on a single line, separated by one or more whitespaces. These represent the collection you’ll be working with.
On the next input lines, until you receive the command **"end"**, you’ll receive a series of commands in one of the following formats:

- **"reverse from [start] count [count]"** – this instructs you to reverse a portion of the array – just [count] elements starting at index [start];
- **"sort from [start] count [count]"** – this instructs you to sort a portion of the array - [count] elements starting at index [start];
- **"rollLeft [count] times"** – this instructs you to move all elements in the array to the left [count] times. On each roll, the first element is placed at the end of the array;
- **"rollRight [count] times"** – this instructs you to move all elements in the array to the right [count] times. On each roll, the last element is placed at the beginning of the array;
If any of the provided indices or counts is **invalid** (non-existent or negative), you should print a message on the console – **"Invalid input parameters."** and **keep the collection unchanged**.
After you’re done, print the resulting array in the following format: **"[arr0, arr1 … arrN]"**. The examples should help you understand the task better.

####Input

- The input data should be read from the console.
- The first input line will hold **a series of strings**, separated by **one or more whitespaces**.
- The next lines will hold **commands** in the described formats (exactly).
- The input ends with the keyword **"end"**.
- The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

####Output

- The output should be printed on the console. 
- Each time an invalid command is received (containing an invalid index or count parameter), print the following line: "Invalid input parameters."
- After receiving the "end" command, print the resulting array on the console in the format specified above.

####Constraints

- The **count of strings** in the collection will be in the range [1 … 50].
- The **number of commands** will be in the range [1 … 20].
- All commands will be in the described format; an invalid command is a command containing invalid [start] or [count], **there won’t be any missing or misspelled words**.
- **[start]** and **[count]** will be integers in the range [-231 … 231 - 1].
- Allowed working time for your program: 0.1 seconds. Allowed memory: 16 MB.

## 03.Rage Quit
####Problem Description
Every gamer knows what rage-quitting means. It’s basically when you’re just not good enough and you blame everybody else for losing a game. You press the **CAPS LOCK** key on the keyboard and flood the chat with gibberish to show your frustration.
Chochko is a gamer, and a bad one at that. He asks for your help; he wants to be the most annoying kid in his team, so when he rage-quits he wants something truly spectacular. He’ll give you a **series of strings** followed by non-negative numbers, e.g. **"a3";** you need to print on the console each string repeated **N times;** convert the letters to **uppercase beforehand**. In the example, you need to write back "AAA". 
On the output, print first a statistic of the number of unique symbols used (the casing of letters is irrelevant, meaning that 'a' and 'A' are the same); the format shoud be "Unique symbols used {0}". Then, print the rage message itself.
The **strings and numbers will not be separated by anything**. The input will always start with a string and for each string there will be a corresponding number. The entire input will be given on a **single line**; Chochko is too lazy to make your job easier.

####Input

- The input data should be read from the console.
- It consists of a single line holding a series of string-number sequences.
- The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

####Output
- The output should be printed on the console. It should consist of **exactly two lines**.
- On the first line, print the number of **unique symbols used** in the message.
- On the second line, print the **resulting rage message** itself.

####Constraints

- The count of **string-number pairs** will be in the range [1 … 20 000].
- Each string will contain any character **except digits**. The **length** of each string will be in the range [1 … 20].
- The **repeat count** for each string will be an integer in the range [0 … 20].
- Allowed working time for your program: 0.3 seconds. Allowed memory: 64 MB.

## 04.Files
#### Problem Description
You are given number of files with their **full file paths** and file **sizes**. You need to **print all file names** with a **given extension** that are present in a **given root directory sorted by their file size** in **descending order**. If two files have **same size**, order them by **alphabetical order**. 
If a file name **(file name + extension) **appears more than once in a given root, **save only its latest value**. If a file name appears in more than one root, they are treated as **different files**.
If there **aren't** any files that correspond to the query, print **"No"**.

####Input / Constrains

- On the first line of input you will get **N** the **number of files to be read from the console**
- On the next N lines, you receive **the actual files in the format "root\folder\filename.extension;filesize"**
- There may be more than one folder e.g. **files can be deeply nested**
- On the last line you receive a query string in format **"{extension} in {root}"**. You need to print all files with the given extension that are in present in the given root

####Output

- You need to print all files sorted by their size in descending order. 
- If two files have the same size, order them by alphabetical order. 
- Files should be printed in the given format **"filename.extension - filesize KB"** 
- If there **aren't any movies** that correspond to the query, print **"No"**.
